## Research project description
We present GradualReality system that enables interaction with physical objects in the immersive virutal environment. Most prior work has relied on the Pass-Through technique, which excessively exposes real-world information in the virtual environment to support interaction. However, this causes an extreme trade-off between usability and immersion, deteriorating the user experience and hindering daily VR usage. To address this issue, we propose an Interaction State-Aware Blending approach for GradualReality system, which gradually blends real-world information in the virtual environment based on the current user's interaction context.
